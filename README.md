# BasicBrowser - FORKED [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/vk3okvf6qmlpykgx)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Walkman100/basicbrowser)
I decided to Fork this webbrowser to show the great potential of it and due to personal needs. I recently discovered that 99% of existing NVRs still use ActiveX and require Internet Explorer. Don't fall for IE Tab, it is NOT free anymore, and it is not open source.

You can Hold <kbd>Alt</kbd> to move the buttons around on the main interface. To reset, simply restart BasicBrowser.

## Download
Get the latest version [here](https://github.com/Walkman100/BasicBrowser/releases), and the latest build from commit
[here](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Walkman100/BasicBrowser/build/artifacts)
(note that these builds are built for the Debug config and so are not optimised)

## Searching from the URL bar
You should be able to search from the URL bar out of the box. If some queries turn into URLs (e.g. `http://test+search/`) instead of your search engines search, use a question mark `?` before the query (e.g. `?test search`).

If this still doesn't work, make sure the `Search in the address bar and the search box on the new tab page` checkbox in the window described below is checked.

## Changing your search engine
Click the menu bar `Tools`, then under `Internet Properties...` select `Manage add-ons...`, then click the `Manage add-ons` button.

In the window that pops up, click the `Search Providers` tab on the left. Here you can select a search provider, then:
- Set it as default
- Remove it
- Enable/disable search suggestions for it (not available in BasicBrowser yet)
- Right-click to move up or down in the listing order

When you are done, click `Close` at the bottom then `OK`.

## Compile requirements
See [CompileInstructions.md](https://github.com/Walkman100/gists/blob/master/CompileInstructions.md)

## Gecko (IE8 alternative)
As of November 2014, the Gecko branch can be found at [Walkman-Mirror/BasicBrowserGecko](https://github.com/Walkman-Mirror/BasicBrowserGecko). The hybrid branch is also there, since it is essentially BasicBrowserGecko with the ability to open IE tabs as well.
